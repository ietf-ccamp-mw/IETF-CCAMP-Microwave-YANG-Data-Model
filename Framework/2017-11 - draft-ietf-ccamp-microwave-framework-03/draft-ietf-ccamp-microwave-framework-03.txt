       A framework for Management and Control of microwave and 
             millimeter wave interface parameters
            draft-ietf-ccamp-microwave-framework-03

Abstract

   To ensure an efficient data transport, meeting the requirements 
   requested by today's transport services, the unification of control
   and management of microwave and millimeter wave radio link interfaces
   is a precondition for seamless multilayer networking and automated
   network wide provisioning and operation.

   This document describes the required characteristics and use cases
   for control and management of radio link interface parameters using a
   YANG Data Model. It focuses on the benefits of a standardized 
   management model that is aligned with how other packet technology
   interfaces in a microwave/millimeter wave node are modeled, the need
   to support core parameters and at the same time allow for optional
   product/feature specific parameters supporting new, unique innovative
   features until they have become mature enough to be included in the 
   standardized model.

   The purpose is to create a framework for identification of the 
   necessary information elements and definition of a YANG Data Model
   for control and management of the radio link interfaces in a 
   microwave/millimeter wave node. Some part of the resulting model MAY 
   be generic which COULD also be used by other technology.

1.  Terminology and Definitions

   Microwave is a band of spectrum with wavelengths ranging from 1
   meter to 1 millimeter and with frequencies ranging between 300 MHz
   and 300 GHz. Microwave radio technology is widely used for point-to-
   point telecommunications because of their small wavelength that
   allows conveniently-sized antennas to direct them in narrow beams,
   and their comparatively higher frequencies that allows broad
   bandwidth and high data transmission rates.

   Millimeter wave is also known as extremely high frequency (EHF) or
   very high frequency (VHF) by the International Telecommunications
   Union (ITU), which can be used for high-speed wireless broadband
   communications. Millimeter wave can be used for a broad range of
   fixed and mobile services including high-speed, point-to-point
   wireless local area networks (WLANs) and broadband access. This band
   has short wavelengths that range from 10 millimeters to 1 
   millimeter, namely millimeter band or millimeter wave. The 71 - 76 
   GHz, 81 - 86 GHz and 92-95 GHz bands are used for point-to-point 
   high-bandwidth communication links, which allows for higher data 
   rates up to 10 Gbit/s but requires a license. Unlicensed short-range 
   data links can be used on 60 GHz millimeter wave. For instance, the
   upcoming IEEE Wi-Fi standard 802.11ad will run on the 60 GHz
   spectrum with data transfer rates of up to 7 Gbit/s.

   ETSI EN 302 217 series defines the characteristics and requirements 
   of microwave/millimeter wave equipment and antennas. Especially ETSI 
   EN 302 217-2 specifies the essential parameters for the systems 
   operating from 1.4GHz to 86GHz. 

   Carrier Termination and Radio Link Terminal are two concepts defined
   to support modeling of microwave radio link features and parameters
   in a structured and yet simple manner. 

   Carrier Termination is an interface for the capacity provided over
   the air by a single carrier. It is typically defined by its
   transmitting and receiving frequencies.

   Radio Link Terminal is an interface providing packet capacity and/or
   TDM capacity to the associated Ethernet and/or TDM interfaces in a
   node and used for setting up a transport service over a
   microwave/millimeter wave link.

   Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of Carrier Termination
   and Radio Link Terminal concepts.

   Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture that 
   decouples the network control and forwarding functions enabling the 
   network control to become directly programmable and the underlying 
   infrastructure to be abstracted for applications and network 
   services. This results in an extremely dynamic, manageable, cost-
   effective, and adaptable architecture that gives administrators 
   unprecedented programmability, automation, and control. The SDN 
   concept is widely applied for network management, the adoption of 
   SDN framework to manage and control the microwave and millimeter 
   wave interface is one of the key applications of this work.

2.  Introduction

   Network requirements vary between operators globally as well as 
   within individual countries. The overall goal is however the same - 
   to deliver the best possible network performance and quality of 
   experience in a cost-efficient way.

   Microwave/millimeter wave (hereafter referred to as microwave, but 
   including the frequency bands represented by millimeter wave) are 
   important technologies to fulfill this goal today, but also in the 
   future when demands on capacity and packet features increases.

   Microwave is already today able to fully support the capacity needs 
   of a backhaul in a radio access network and will evolve to support 
   multiple gigabits in traditional frequency bands and beyond 10 
   gigabits in the millimeter wave. L2 packet features are normally an 
   integrated part of microwave nodes and more advanced L2 & L3 
   features will over time be introduced to support the evolution of 
   the transport services to be provided by a backhaul/transport 
   network. Note that the wireless access technologies such as 3/4/5G & 
   WiFi are not within the scope of this microwave model work.

   The main application for microwave is backhaul for mobile broadband. 
   Those networks will continue to be modernized using a combination of 
   microwave and fiber technologies. The choice of technology is a 
   question about fiber presence and cost of ownership, not about 
   capacity limitations in microwave.

   Open and standardized interfaces are a pre-requisite for efficient 
   management of equipment from multiple vendors, integrated in a 
   single system/controller. This framework addresses management and 
   control of the radio link interface(s) and the relationship to other 
   packet interfaces, typically to Ethernet interfaces, in a microwave 
   node. A radio link provides the transport over the air, using one or 
   several carriers in aggregated or protected configurations.  
   Managing and controlling a transport service over a microwave node 
   involves both radio link and packet functionality.

   Already today there are numerous IETF data models, RFCs and drafts, 
   with technology specific extensions that cover a large part of the 
   packet domain. Examples are IP Management [RFC7277], Routing 
   Management [RFC8022] and Provider Bridge [PB-YANG] They are based 
   on the IETF YANG model for Interface Management [RFC7223], which is
   an evolution of the SNMP IF-MIB [RFC2863].

   Since microwave nodes will contain more and more packet 
   functionality which is expected to be managed using those models, 
   there are advantages if radio link interfaces can be modeled and be 
   managed using the same structure and the same approach, specifically 
   for use cases in which a microwave node are managed as one common 
   entity including both the radio link and the packet functionality, 
   e.g. at basic configuration of node & connections, centralized 
   trouble shooting, upgrade and maintenance. All interfaces in a node, 
   irrespective of technology, would then be accessed from the same 
   core model, i.e. [RFC7223], and could be extended with technology 
   specific parameters in models augmenting that core model. The 
   relationship/connectivity between interfaces could be given by the 
   physical equipment configuration, e.g the slot in which the Radio 
   Link Terminal (modem) is plugged in could be associated with a 
   specific Ethernet port due to the wiring in the backplane of the 
   system, or it could be flexible and therefore configured via a 
   management system or controller.

   There will always be certain implementations that differ among 
   products and it is therefore practically impossible to achieve 
   industry consensus on every design detail. It is therefore important 
   to focus on the parameters that are required to support the use 
   cases applicable for centralized, unified, multi-vendor management 
   and to allow other parameters to be optional or to be covered by 
   extensions to the standardized model. Furthermore, a standard that 
   allows for a certain degree of freedom encourages innovation and 
   competition which is something that benefits the entire industry. It 
   is therefore important that a radio link management model covers all 
   relevant functions but also leaves room for product/feature-specific 
   extensions.

   For microwave radio link functionality work has been initiated (ONF: 
   Microwave Modeling [ONF-model], IETF: Radio Link Model [I-
   D.ahlbergccamp-microwave-radio-link]. The purpose of this effort is 
   to reach consensus within the industry around one common approach, 
   with respect to the use cases and requirements to be supported, the 
   type and structure of the model and the resulting attributes to be 
   included. This document describes the use cases and requirements 
   agreed to be covered, the expected characteristics of the model and 
   at the end includes an analysis of how the models in the two on-
   going initiatives fulfill these expectations and a recommendation on 
   what can be reused and what gaps need to be filled by a new and 
   evolved radio link model.

4.  Approaches to manage and control radio link interfaces

   This framework addresses the definition of an open and standardized 
   interface for the radio link functionality in a microwave/millimeter 
   wave node. The application of such an interface used for management 
   and control of nodes and networks typically vary from one operator 
   to another, in terms of the systems used and how they interact. A 
   traditional solution is network management system, while an emerging 
   one is SDN. SDN solutions can be used as part of the network 
   management system, allowing for direct network programmability and 
   automated configurability by means of a centralized SDN control and 
   defining standardized interfaces to program the nodes.

4.1.  Network Management Solutions

   The classic network management solutions, with vendor specific 
   domain management combined with cross domain functionality for 
   service management and analytics, still dominates the market.
   These solutions are expected to evolve and benefit from an increased 
   focus on standardization by simplifying multi-vendor management and 
   remove the need for vendor/domain specific management.

4.2.  Software Defined Networking

   One of the main drivers for applying SDN from an operator 
   perspective is simplification and automation of network provisioning 
   as well as E2E network service management. The vision is to have a 
   global view of the network conditions spanning across different 
   vendors' equipment and multiple technologies.

   If nodes from different vendors shall be managed by the same SDN 
   controller via a node management interface (north bound interface, 
   NBI), without the extra effort of introducing intermediate systems, 
   all nodes must align their node management interfaces. Hence, an 
   open and standardized node management interface are required in a 
   multi-vendor environment. Such standardized interface enables a 
   unified management and configuration of nodes from different vendors 
   by a common set of applications.

   On top of SDN applications to configure, manage and control the 
   nodes and their associated transport interfaces including the L2 and 
   L3 packet/Ethernet interfaces as well as the radio interfaces, there 
   are also a large variety of other more advanced SDN applications 
   that can be exploited and/or developed.

   A potential flexible approach for the operators is to use SDN in a 
   logical control way to manage the radio links by selecting a 
   predefined operation mode. The operation mode is a set of logical 
   metrics or parameters describing a complete radio link 
   configuration, such as capacity, availability, priority and power 
   consumption.

   An example of an operation mode table is shown in Figure 3. Based on 
   its operation policy (e.g., power consumption or traffic priority), 
   the SDN controller selects one operation mode and translates that 
   into the required configuration of the individual parameters for the 
   radio link terminals and the associated carrier terminations.

  | 1  |High capacity  |  400 Mbps  | 99.9%       | Low       |High  |

   An operation mode bundles together the values of a set of different 
   parameters. How each operation mode maps into certain set of 
   attributes is out of scope of this document. Effort on a 
   standardizing operation mode is required to implement a smoothly 
   operator environment.

5.  Use Cases

   The use cases described should be the basis for identification and 
   definition of the parameters to be supported by a YANG Data model 
   for management of radio links, applicable for centralized, unified, 
   multi-vendor management.

   Other product specific use cases, addressing e.g. installation, on-
   site trouble shooting and fault resolution, are outside the scope of 
   this framework. If required, these use cases are expected to be 
   supported by product specific extensions to the standardized model.

5.1.  Configuration Management

   Configuration of a radio link terminal, the constituent carrier 
   terminations and when applicable the relationship to packet/Ethernet 
   and TDM interfaces.

5.1.1.  Understand the capabilities & limitations

   Exchange of information between a manager and a device about the 
   capabilities supported and specific limitations in the parameter 
   values & enumerations that can be used.

   Support for the XPIC (Cross Polarization Interference Cancellation) 
   feature or not and the maximum modulation supported are two examples 
   on information that could be exchanged.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-ccamp-microwave-framework-03   November 2017


5.1.2.  Initial Configuration

   Initial configuration of a radio link terminal, enough to establish 
   L1 connectivity over the hop to an associated radio link terminal on 
   a device at far end. It MAY also include configuration of the 
   relationship between a radio link terminal and an associated traffic 
   interface, e.g. an Ethernet interface, unless that is given by the 
   equipment configuration.

   Frequency, modulation, coding and output power are examples of 
   parameters typically configured for a carrier termination and type 
   of aggregation/bonding or protection configurations expected for a 
   radio link terminal.

5.1.3.  Radio link re-configuration & optimization

   Re-configuration, update or optimization of an existing radio link 
   terminal. Output power and modulation for a carrier termination and 
   protection schemas and activation/de-activation of carriers in a 
   radio link terminal are examples on parameters that can be re-
   configured and used for optimization of the performance of a 
   network.

5.1.4.  Radio link logical configuration

   Radio link terminals comprising a group of carriers are widely used 
   in microwave technology. There are several kinds of groups: 
   aggregation/bonding, 1+1 protection/redundancy, etc. To avoid 
   configuration on each carrier termination directly, a logical 
   control provides flexible management by mapping a logical 
   configuration to a set of physical attributes. This could also be 
   applied in a hierarchical SDN environment where some domain 
   controllers are located between the SDN controller and the radio 
   link terminal.

5.2.  Inventory

5.2.1.  Retrieve logical inventory & configuration from device

   Request from manager and response by device with information about 
   radio interfaces, their constitution and configuration.

5.2.2.  Retrieve physical/equipment inventory from device

   Request from manager about physical and/or equipment inventory 
   associated with the radio link terminals and carrier terminations.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-ccamp-microwave-framework-03   November 2017


5.3.  Status & statistics

5.3.1.  Actual status & performance of a radio link interface

   Manager requests and device responds with information about actual 
   status and statistics of configured radio link interfaces and their 
   constituent parts.

5.4.  Performance management

5.4.1.  Configuration of historical measurements to be performed

   Configuration of historical measurements to be performed on a radio 
   link interface and/or its constituent parts is a subset of the 
   configuration use case to be supported. See 5.1 above.

5.4.2.  Collection of historical performance data

   Collection of historical performance data in bulk by the manager is 
   a general use case for a device and not specific to a radio link 
   interface.

   Collection of an individual counter for a specific interval is in 
   same cases required as a complement to the retrieval in bulk as 
   described above.

5.5.  Fault Management

5.5.1.  Configuration of alarm reporting

   Configuration of alarm reporting associated specifically with radio 
   interfaces, e.g. configuration of alarm severity, is a subset of the 
   configuration use case to be supported. See 5.1 above.

5.5.2.  Alarm management

   Alarm synchronization, visualization & handling, and notifications & 
   events are generic use cases for a device and not specific to a 
   radio link interface and should be supported accordingly.

5.6.  Troubleshooting and Root Cause Analysis

   Information and actions required by a manager/operator to 
   investigate and understand the underlying issue to a problem in the 
   performance and/or functionality of a radio link terminal and the 
   associated carrier terminations.

6.  Requirements

   For managing a microwave node including both the radio link and the 
   packet functionality, a unified data model is desired to unify the 
   modeling of the radio link interfaces and the packet interfaces 
   using the same structure and the same modelling approach. If some 
   part of model is generic for other technology usage, it should be 
   clearly stated. 

   The purpose of the YANG Data Model is for management and control of 
   the radio link interface(s) and the relationship/connectivity to 
   other packet interfaces, typically to Ethernet interfaces, in a 
   microwave node.

   The capability of configuring and managing microwave nodes includes 
   the following requirements for the modelling:

   1) It MUST be possible to configure, manage and control a radio link 
      terminal and the constituent carrier terminations.

      a) Frequency, channel bandwidth, modulation, coding and
         transmitter power are examples of parameters typically
         configured for a carrier termination.

      b) A radio link terminal MUST configure the associated carrier
         terminations and the type of aggregation/bonding or protection
         configurations expected for the radio link terminal.

      c) The capability, e.g. the maximum modulation supported, and the
         actual status/statistics, e.g. administrative status of the 
         carriers, SHOULD also be supported by the data model.

      d) The definition of the features and parameters SHOULD be based
         on established microwave equipment and radio standards, such
         as ETSI EN 302 217 [EN 302 217-2] which specifies the essential
         parameters for microwave systems operating from 1.4GHz to 
         86GHz.

   2) It MUST be possible to map different traffic types (e.g. TDM,
      Ethernet) to the transport capacity provided by a specific radio
      link terminal.

   3) It MUST be possible to configure and collect historical
      measurements (for the use case described in section 5.4) to be
      performed on a radio link interface, e.g. minimum, maximum and
      average transmit power and receive level in dBm.

   4) It MUST be possible to configure and retrieve alarms reporting 
      associated with the radio interfaces, e.g. configuration of alarm
      severity, supported alarms like configuration fault, signal lost,
      modem fault, radio fault.

7.  Gap Analysis on Models

   The purpose of the gap analysis is to identify and recommend what 
   existing and established models as well as draft models under 
   definition to support the use cases and requirements specified in 
   the previous chapters. It shall also make a recommendation on how 
   the gaps not supported should be filled, including the need for 
   development of new models and evolution of existing models and 
   drafts.

   For microwave radio link functionality work has been initiated (ONF: 
   Microwave Modeling [ONF-model], IETF: Radio Link Model [I-
   D.ahlbergccamp-microwave-radio-link]. The analysis is expected to 
   take these initiatives into consideration and make a recommendation 
   on how to make use of them and how to complement them in order to 
   fill the gaps identified.

   For generic functionality, not specific for radio link, the ambition 
   is to refer to existing or emerging models that could be applicable 
   for all functional areas in a microwave node.

7.1.  Microwave Radio Link Functionality

   [ONF CIM] defines a CoreModel of the ONF Common Information Model. 
   An information model describes the things in a domain in terms of 
   objects, their properties (represented as attributes), and their 
   relationships. The ONF information model is expressed in Unified 
   Modeling Language (UML). The ONF CoreModel is independent of 
   specific data plane technology. Data plane technology specific 
   properties are acquired in a runtime solution via "filled in" cases 
   of specification (LtpSpec etc). These can be used to augment the 
   CoreModel to provide a data plane technology specific representation.

   IETF Data Model defines an implementation and NETCONF-specific 
   details. YANG is a data modeling language used to model the 
   configuration and state data. It is well aligned with the structure 
   of the Yang data models proposed for the different packet interfaces 
   which are all based on [RFC7223]. Furthermore, several YANG data 
   models have been proposed in the IETF for other transport 
   technologies such as optical transport; e.g. [RFC7277], 
   [I.D.zhang-ccamp-l1-topo-yang], [I.D.ietf-ospf-yang]. In light of 
   this trend, the IETF data model is becoming a popular approach for 
   modeling most packet transport technology interfaces and it is 
   thereby well positioned to become an industry standard.

   [RFC3444] explains the difference between Information Model(IM) and
   Data Models(DM). IM is to model managed objects at a conceptual level
   for designers and operators, DM is defined at a lower level and
   includes many details for implementers. In addition, the 
   protocol-specific details are usually included in DM. Since 
   conceptual models can be implemented in different ways, multiple DMs 
   can be derived from a single IM. To ensure better interoperability, 
   it is better to focus on DM directly.

Ahlberg, et al.          Expires May 6, 2018                   [Page 13]

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-ccamp-microwave-framework-03   November 2017

   [RFC7223] describes an interface management model, however it doesn't 
   include technology specific information, e.g., for radio interface. 
   [I-D.ahlberg-ccamp-microwave-radio-link] provides a model proposal 
   for radio interfaces, which includes support for basic configuration, 
   status and performance but lacks full support for alarm management 
   and interface layering, i.e. the connectivity of the transported 
   capacity (TDM & Ethernet) with other internal technology specific 
   interfaces in a microwave node. 

   The recommendation is to use the structure of the IETF: Radio Link 
   Model [I-D.ahlberg-ccamp-microwave-radio-link] as the starting point, 
   since it is a data model providing the wanted alignment with
   [RFC7223]. For the definition of the detailed leafs/parameters, the 
   recommendation is to use the IETF: Radio Link Model and the ONF: 
   Microwave Modeling [ONF-model] as the basis and to define new ones 
   to cover identified gaps. The parameters in those models have been 
   defined by both operators and vendors within the industry and the 
   implementations of the ONF Model have been tested in the Proof of 
   Concept events in multi-vendor environments, showing the validity of 
   the approach proposed in this framework document.

   It is also recommended to add the required data nodes to describe 
   the interface layering for the capacity provided by a radio link 
   terminal and the associated Ethernet and TDM interfaces in a 
   microwave node. The principles and data nodes for interface layering 
   described in [RFC7223] should be used as a basis.

7.2.  Generic Functionality

   For generic functionality, not specific for radio link, the 
   recommendation is to refer to existing RFCs or emerging drafts 
   according to the table in figure 4 below. New Radio Link Model is 
   used in the table for the cases where the functionality is 
   recommended to be included in the new radio link model as described 
   in chapter 7.1.

    Figure 4. Recommendation on how to support generic functionality

   Microwave specific alarm configurations are recommended to be 
   included in the new radio link model and could be based on what is 
   supported in the IETF and ONF Radio Link Models. Alarm notifications 
   and synchronization are general and is recommended to be supported 
   by a generic model, such as [I-D.vallin-ccamp-alarm-module].

   Activation of interval counters & thresholds could be a generic 
   function but it is recommended to be supported by the new radio link 
   specific model and can be based on both the ONF and IETF Microwave 
   Radio Link models.

   Collection of interval/historical counters is a generic function 
   that needs to be supported in a node. File based collection via SFTP 
   and collection via a Netconf/YANG interfaces are two possible 
   options and the recommendation is to include support for the latter 
   in the new radio link specific model. The ONF and IETF Microwave 
   Radio Link models can be used as a basis also in this area.

   Physical and/or equipment inventory associated with the radio link 
   terminals and carrier terminations is recommended to be covered by a 
   model generic for the complete node, e.g. [I-D.ietf-netmod-entity] 
   and it is thereby outside the scope of the radio link specific 
   model.

7.3.  Summary

   The conclusions and recommendations from the analysis can be 
   summarized as follows:

   1) A Microwave Radio Link YANG Data Model should be defined with a
      scope enough to support the use cases and requirements in
      chapter 5 and 6 of this document.

   2) Use the structure in the IETF: Radio Link Model [I-D.ahlberg-
      ccamp-microwave-radio-link] as the starting point. It augments
      [RFC7223] and is thereby as required aligned with the structure
      of the models for management of the packet domain.

   3) Use established microwave equipment and radio standards, such
      as [EN 302 217-2], and the IETF: Radio Link Model
      [I-D.ahlberg-ccamp-microwave-radio-link] and the 
      ONF: Microwave Modeling [ONF-model] as the basis for the 
      definition of the detailed leafs/parameters to support the
      specified use cases and requirements, and proposing new ones
      to cover identified gaps.

   4) Add the required data nodes to describe the interface layering
      for the capacity provided by a radio link terminal and the
      associated Ethernet and TDM interfaces, using the principles
      and data nodes for interface layering described in [RFC7223] as
      a basis.

   5) Include support for configuration of microwave specific alarms
      in the Microwave Radio Link model and rely on a generic model
      such as [I.D.vallin-ccamp-alarm-module] for notifications and
      alarm synchronization.

   6) Use a generic model such as [I-D.ietf-netmod-entity] for
      physical/equipment inventory.

   It is furthermore recommended that the Microwave Radio Link YANG
   Date Model should be validated by both operators and vendors as 
   part of the process to make it stable and mature. During the 
   Hackathon in IETF 99, a project "SDN Applications for microwave 
   radio link via IETF YANG Data Model" successfully validated this 
   framework and the YANG data model[I.D.ietf-ccamp-mw-yang]. The 
   project also received the BEST OVERALL award from the Hackathon.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security issue concerning the access control to Management interfaces
   can be generally addressed by authentication techniques providing
   origin verification, integrity and confidentiality. In additon,
   management interfaces can be physically or logically isolated, 
   by configuring them to be only accessible out-of-band, through
   a system that is physically or logically separated from the rest of
   the network infrastructure.  In case where management interfaces are
   accessible in-band at the client device or within the microwave 
   transport netork domain, filtering or firewalling techniques
   can be used to restrict unauthorized in-band traffic. Authentication
   techniques may be additionally used in all cases.

   This framework describes the requirements and charactersitics of
   of a YANG Data Model for control and management of the radio link
   interfaces in a microwave node. It is supposed to be accessed via a
   management protocol with a secure transport layer, such as NETCONF
   [RFC6241].

9.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
